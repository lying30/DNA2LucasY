| October 9  |   2:20-3pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Spent class tim writing some comments and brainstorming some solutions that could work. |
| October 10 | 12:40-1:40pm |                                                                                                                               I talked some ideas out with Mr. Blick utilizing the whiteboard to discuss a solution where we map each letter to a number to create a constant time lookup comparison between two numbers instead of two letters. Also, I continued to update comments and ended feeling confident I knew where to go with my first attempt. |
| October 13 |   10-12:30   | I implemented the idea and originally it only worked for 3 test cases. I realized I should account for the lowercase and N letters that were causing my code to break. Conveniently, the sequences are strings so I used the touppercase function to convert them all in the STR and sequence. Then I handled the N by adding it the hash map as -1 and if the letter corresponds to -1 that is being looked at, it will return a false match and continue. |
