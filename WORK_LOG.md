| October 10 | 12:40-1:40pm | I talked some ideas out with Mr. Blick utilizing the whiteboard to discuss a solution where we map each letter to a number to create a constant time lookup comparison between two numbers instead of two letters. Also, I continued to update comments and ended feeling confident I knew where to go with my first attempt. |
