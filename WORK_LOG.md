| October 9  |   2:20-3pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Spent class tim writing some comments and brainstorming some solutions that could work. |
| October 10 | 12:40-1:40pm |                                                                                                                               I talked some ideas out with Mr. Blick utilizing the whiteboard to discuss a solution where we map each letter to a number to create a constant time lookup comparison between two numbers instead of two letters. Also, I continued to update comments and ended feeling confident I knew where to go with my first attempt. |
| October 13 |   10-12:30   | I implemented the idea and originally it only worked for 3 test cases. I realized I should account for the lowercase and N letters that were causing my code to break. Conveniently, the sequences are strings so I used the touppercase function to convert them all in the STR and sequence. Then I handled the N by adding it the hash map as -1 and if the letter corresponds to -1 that is being looked at, it will return a false match and continue. |
| October 18 |   11-12pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Worked through adding hash method to my code and trying to see where I should add different functions and what parts of my code are worth keeping. |
| October 21 |    12-2am    |                                                                                                               Finished the Hash function, updated the update hash function, also updated the matches function but then realized i dont need that bc i should do monte carlo method. I need to also change up my iteration for the sequence for the polynomial rolling hash function version, but i wrote some psuedocode to help guide me for next session. |
| October 21 |   1:50-3pm   |                                                                                                                                                              Updated iteration of my hashing, and it works kinda. Need to figure out some bugs in the code and make sure all the logic is correct because my code only passes one test case. I also would like to make it faster and maybe I can make my radix 4 and implement my hashmap into my solution. |
| October 22 |   6:45-8pm   |                                                                                                               I am hitting a roadblock and trying to debug my code. I am a little frustrated at the moment and gonna take break and come back. I dont know why it is returning 1 for everything so i should look back through my code. Also i might try and combine my old strategy of a hash map into this new solution to speed it up after, but idk yet. |
| October 22 | 8:30pm-10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I debugged and realized I was doing it wrong, and I also realized i should be using longs. I went through and commented the code as well. finished!! |
